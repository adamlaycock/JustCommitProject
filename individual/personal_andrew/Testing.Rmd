# Dataset Background

## The Dataset
- Covers 1.6 million weather events in the United States and U.S. territories from 1996-2023.
- Collected by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
- Contains data on 50 variables regarding event details, and 8 variables regarding event fatalities


## What is a 'Storm Event'?
- According to the NOAA, storm events are 'weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce.'
- Multiple storm events are grouped into storm episodes.
