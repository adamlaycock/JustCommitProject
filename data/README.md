All orginal files can be found at [NOAA Storm Events Data Dump](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/).

Details, fatalities, and locations csv files relating to the years 1996-2024 were manually downloaded and unzipped before being concatenated by [NOAA Compile Script.py](https://github.com/adamlaycock/JustCommitProject/blob/main/data/NOAA%20Compile%20Script.py).

Dataset size after concatenation is too large for GitHub limits. 
Please find the concatenated files for 1996-2024 [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GBYKf2U7KENUbPExLoedF3kvNTHPWNCQ?usp=sharing).
